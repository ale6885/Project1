				<h2 class="section-title">Something about the song:</h2>
				<p class="page-paragraph">Because she had sold her rights outright for $3,000, Simone lost more than $1
					million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of her version of the jazz standard "My Baby
					Just Cares for Me") and never benefited financially from the album's sales. After Simone realised
					her mistake and went to Colpix Records, Bethlehem put out a cobbled together second album "Nina
					Simone and Her Friends" but it wasn't until 1987, when My Baby Just Cares for Me exploded in Europe,
					that it really hit her pocket. That said, the exposure (the song featured in a perfume commercial)
					brought Simone to a new audience and allowed her to work only when she needed to until her death in
					2003.</p>
